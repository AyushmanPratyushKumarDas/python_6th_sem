The rain fell like ash from a dying sky, soaking through the velvet of her dress as Seraphina walked the narrow cobbled path toward the manor. Midnight wrapped the world in a hush, yet the house ahead blazed with candlelight, windows glowing like the eyes of a hungry beast. She hesitated, fingers brushing the iron gate, and felt it tremble beneath her touch. It had been ten years since she’d seen him.

Ten years since she had run.

Inside, the air pulsed with heat. Music drifted from somewhere deep in the manor, slow and aching—piano notes like broken promises echoing through marbled halls. She stepped in, dripping, trembling, heart clawing at her ribs. And then he was there.

Lucien.

He emerged from the shadows with the quiet grace of a predator. Black suit tailored like a second skin, hair longer now, swept back to reveal high cheekbones and eyes the color of blood just before it dries—deep, ancient, and knowing. Time had not softened him; it had sharpened him, like a blade honed in darkness.

"You're late," he murmured, voice a sin whispered behind cathedral walls.

Seraphina swallowed hard. "I shouldn’t have come."

"But you did." He took a step closer, and the room felt smaller. "Even after what I did to you."

She remembered—oh, she remembered everything. The way he’d loved her with a madness no one else could survive. The bruises on her neck, the trembling in her thighs, the bruised petals of her mouth after every kiss. It had been obsession, not love. And yet…

And yet.

"You always knew I'd come back," she said, chin tilted, defiant and undone all at once.

Lucien smiled, a slow, cruel thing. "Because you were never free, my love. You just thought you were."

She hated him then. Hated the way her body leaned into his voice, hated the heat pooling in her belly, hated that even now, after the scars he left, she still dreamed of his touch.

"Don’t mistake possession for affection," she said. "You broke me."

He moved again, now only a breath away. “No, darling. I remade you.”

And with that, he kissed her—without permission, without apology. It was brutal and hungry, like he needed to taste the ten years she had stolen from him. Her hands rose to push him away, but they curled into his shirt instead, clutching, trembling. She hated herself for the whimper in her throat, the way her knees buckled.

Lucien caught her, arms like steel beneath his silk. “Tell me to stop.”

She didn’t.

He led her through the manor like a ghost guiding the damned. Every corner whispered memory. That room where he first read her poetry, voice low and reverent. The window seat where they once made love as a storm raged outside. His chamber, where the line between worship and ruin had blurred so easily.

He sat her on the edge of the bed, shadows dancing across his face. “I should be gentle,” he murmured, dragging a thumb along her jaw. “But you never wanted that, did you?”

"No," she admitted, breathless.

His fingers trailed down her throat, to the laces of her soaked dress. Slowly, teasingly, he began to undo her, unravel her. Each layer discarded felt like a confession. And when she was bare before him, she saw it—not just lust, but hunger, despair, rage. A man broken long before she met him, who had bled himself dry trying to love without destroying.

"You were always my favorite sin," he whispered.

"And you," she breathed, "were always my damnation."

Then his mouth was on her neck, her collarbone, descending. His hands claimed her, memorized her anew. It was not sweet. It was not kind. It was desperate, feral—two creatures who had no right to love, finding salvation in each other's pain. They moved together in the dark like a prayer made of curses, like an elegy whispered against skin.

After, her body ached with memory, with him. She lay on the sheets—still trembling, still ruined—and watched as he sat at the edge of the bed, back turned, breathing like he’d run for miles.

"You never changed," she said.

"And you never left me," he replied without turning.

There was silence then. The kind that screamed between people who loved too much and too wrong.

She reached for him. Fingers brushed his spine. He flinched.

"You scare me, Lucien."

He turned, eyes softening like dusk after storm. "I scare myself."

She sat up, tangled hair falling around her like a curtain. "So what now?"

"You go," he said, voice hoarse. "Or you stay. But if you stay… I can’t promise to be better."

She looked at him, really looked—at the man who had caged her heart and fed it to the wolves. And she saw something most would miss: a flicker of regret, buried so deep it bled.

Seraphina slid closer, pressed her forehead to his. "Maybe we don't need better. Maybe we just need honest."

Lucien exhaled like a man finally breathing after drowning. “Then be mine again, in truth. No cages. Just fire.”

And she, broken and whole all at once, whispered, “Yes.”

The rain outside turned to snow.
